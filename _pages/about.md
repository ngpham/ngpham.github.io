My name, in Vietnamese, is Phạm Đình Nguyên.
I have more than a few too many interests, thus, have become a Jack of many (not all) trades,
master of none.

I would love to blog sometimes. After all, people say that one should have an
online profile. Totally agreed, we are living the age of, not data/AI/green-tech/crypt-currency...
but marketing. However, as I have seen so many excellent blogs, books, papers,
source code,... I concluded that the bar is high. It is tough to create an artifact which is both
new and interesting.

### Others
If you care about my face, please check my facebook. For this blog, my avatar is a trefoil knot,
drawn with 11 segments. Below is the
6-segment animation, inspired by [Kaleidoscope](http://www.chiptune.com/kaleidoscope/).

Since 2016, I started teaching myself piano, and will keep saving some of the progress on my youtube.
